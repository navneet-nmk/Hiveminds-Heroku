8 a.m. To market,"Explore the outdoorsy parts of Trinidad that are within easy reach of Port of Spain. Begin at the Green Market Santa Cruz, a farmers’ market set in a garden a 20-minute drive from the city on the road to Maracas Bay. It is part of a working farm; vendors sell organic produce, mango chutneys and jars of chadon beni sauce (made from a cilantrolike herb), flowers and crafts, as well as snacks like Venezuelan arepas and the uniquely Trini “doubles,” the version here made with pigeon peas instead of chickpeas, well spiced and sandwiched between two pieces of fried bread. Add a cup of cocoa tea, a sweet local drink made from ground cocoa beans and spices. "
3 P.M. Hit the spot,"One of the coolest new additions to Port of Spain’s food scene is a stationary food truck called G-Spot on Maraval Road. Here you’ll find what’s quite possibly the healthiest and most contemporary food on the whole island: grain bowls made with a blend of brown and red jasmine rice, topped with grilled vegetables, tamarind sauce and chutney; crepes stuffed with handmade pork and beef sausage from the local producer Del Mano, and sides of dasheen (taro) mashed with butter, milk and fresh herbs. Try the Trinitella for dessert: a sweet crepe filled with a spread made from hazelnuts and Trini chocolate. G-Spot closes at 4 p.m. but has occasional evening “cheat nights”; check the Facebook page for details. "
5 p.m. The art of chocolate,"A short walk from G-Spot is a striking house with elaborate wooden fittings designed by the architect-turned-chocolatier Isabel Brash. This is where Ms. Brash creates Cocobel, exquisite chocolates produced with world-class cocoa beans from her family’s estate in southern Trinidad, and flavored with local ingredients like mango, Scotch bonnet peppers, passion fruit and honey. Stock up on chocolate bars, barks and nibs, then walk down the spiral staircase to the Medulla Art Gallery, which focuses on contemporary Trinidadian and Caribbean art and the work of the Caribbean diaspora. "
11 a.m. Shop local,"Drive north from the Green Market to Maracas Bay, along a Head north to the St. Ann’s neighborhood to find a wealth of souvenirs at the Shop at the Normandie, a small complex of stores in the Hotel Normandie that showcase local designers and makers. Pick up books, jewelry, fudge and bars of chocolate, shea butter soaps and beauty products produced from local ingredients, along with swimsuits and colorful resort wear by designers like Meiling and Rebel. Then step across the parking lot to B3 Wine & Spirits, a chic booze shop that also functions as a bar, where you can find one of the country’s most famous exports, Angostura Rum (the 1919 is a popular choice). Throw in a bottle of Angostura Bitters while you’re at it. "
7:30 p.m. Savannah street food,"The sprawling Queen’s Park Savannah is the heart of the city, with amateur cricketers playing on the park’s green lawns on weekends, and food stalls serving up some of the best casual dining in town after dusk. Head for the cluster of white tents, bright lights and music and stroll through, picking up corn soup flavored with vinegar and studded with chunks of carrots and corn on the cob, pholourie (dumplings, lightly fried and served with a sweet dipping sauce), chicken feet and cow heels pickled with slices of cucumber (called souse). Then finish with a bag of the sweet and savory “chow”: slices of peeled fruit, often underripe mango, salted and doused with a peppery garlic sauce. Dinner for two, around 100 Trinidad/Tobago dollars, or about $15. Vendors on the perimeter of the park will open a fresh coconut for 10 dollars. "
9 a.m. Open-air breakfast,"In the shadow of the Hyatt Regency hotel, just off busy Wrightson Road, the Breakfast Shed serves up local food from stalls with names like Bern’s Tasty Pot and Dollo’s Delights. The Shed is the place to come for pillowy fried bread, stewed okra and eggplant, and salted and fried fish (around 35 dollars). Wash your breakfast down with a tamarind or sorrel (hibiscus) juice. The no-frills picnic tables look over the water. "
12:30 p.m. Sunday dinner,"Sunday midday dinner is a Trini tradition. Head to Creole Kitchen, a cafeteria-style restaurant that looks out of place among the newer businesses that have sprung up around it. Locals pop in to pick up hearty takeaway containers of stewed chicken, macaroni pie topped with toasted cheese, and callaloo, a West African-influenced dish of taro leaves and coconut milk, but there are also tables for eating in. "
9 p.m. Out at the box,"One of the most cosmopolitan venues in Trinidad, the Big Black Box hosts events Friday evenings — from sets by EDM (electronic dance music) DJ.s to plays by local writers. Just off Ariapita Avenue (known as “the Avenue”), the Box is a sophisticated yet friendly place where hip young Trinis come for something different. The open-air venue has a bar, basic seating and a stage. Check its Facebook page to see what’s on. "
